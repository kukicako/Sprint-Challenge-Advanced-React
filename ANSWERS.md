To see and control the life cycle of your component. It is alot more code and much harder to read but you can see what is going on behind the scenes.

<!-- - [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes. -->

ComponentDidMount- it renders and loads ur component for the first time 

shouldComponentUpdate - use to stop a component from calling render if neccesary

ComponentWillUnmount- The death of your component. any clean up u need to do.
